# SAT-optimized-solver

## Overview

This project implements two optimization algorithms, Simulated Annealing and Genetic Algorithm, to solve the Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) problem. Both algorithms aim to find a variable assignment that satisfies the maximum number of clauses in a given SAT formula, which is provided in CNF (Conjunctive Normal Form).

The project consists of two parts:

    Simulated Annealing (sat-simulatedannealing.py)
    Genetic Algorithm (sat-genetics.py)

These algorithms are tested using CNF files formatted according to the DIMACS standard.

## 1. Simulated Annealing

### Objective:

To iteratively improve a random variable assignment by introducing small changes (random flips) and using a probabilistic acceptance mechanism to escape local optima.

### Steps:

    1. A random solution (assignment of variables) is generated.
    2. The fitness of the solution (number of satisfied clauses) is calculated.
    3. A neighboring solution is generated by flipping a variable.
    4. If the new solution improves the fitness, it is accepted. Otherwise, it may still be accepted with a probability that decreases as the system "cools down" (temperature decreases over time).
    5. The algorithm runs for a fixed number of iterations, after which the best solution found is returned.

### Results:

The plot of fitness (satisfied clauses) over iterations shows how the algorithm progresses in finding better solutions.
Simulated annealing may find near-optimal solutions, especially if the cooling rate and initial temperature are properly tuned.

## 2. Genetic Algorithm

### Objective:

To simulate the process of natural selection by evolving a population of solutions over several generations, using crossover and mutation operations.

### Steps:

    1. A population of random solutions is initialized.
    2. Each solutionâ€™s fitness is evaluated based on how many clauses it satisfies.
    3. The top-performing solutions (parents) are selected, and crossover is used to create offspring solutions by combining parts of the parents.
    4. Mutation is applied to the offspring to introduce small random changes.
    5. The best solution over all generations is returned as the result.

### Results:

A plot of fitness (satisfied clauses) over generations shows the evolution of solutions.
Over time, the genetic algorithm improves the fitness of solutions, often converging on an optimal or near-optimal solution.
Genetic algorithms tend to perform well when population size, mutation rate, and crossover methods are properly chosen.

## Conclusion 

Both algorithms aim to maximize the number of satisfied clauses in the SAT problem, but they approach the task differently:

* Simulated Annealing explores solutions one at a time, accepting worse solutions with a probability that decreases as the temperature cools, allowing the algorithm to escape local optima.
* Genetic Algorithm works with a population of solutions, applying crossover and mutation to evolve better solutions over generations.

Common Insights:

Both algorithms improve the quality of solutions over time, though convergence rates may differ.
* Simulated Annealing is simpler and faster in some cases but might not always find global optima.
* Genetic Algorithm is more robust in exploring the search space and tends to find better solutions, but it can be computationally expensive for large populations or many generations.
